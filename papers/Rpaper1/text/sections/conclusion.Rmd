We have explored three famous experiments. Michelson and Morley's null result is understood as having truly shown that a theoretical light-propagation medium, the luminiferous aether, was unsupported and unnecessary. Mendel presented a failure to find deviations from theoretical values, but Fisher noted that these results were actually *too close* to their theoretical values, calling the evidential value of the data into doubt. Finally, the LIGO team failed many times over more than a decade to detect gravitational waves, but never claimed evidence that gravitational waves do not exist. Eventually detecting gravitational waves won them the Nobel prize in physics in 2017. We can take several lessons from these three cases. 

**"Accepting the null" is not a purely statistical affair; it occurs in a theoretical context.** Michelson and Morley's result appeared more compelling because an alternative to wave theory could account for the result. On the other hand, there is no alternative to general relativity, so the lack of gravitational waves would throw physics into crisis. Mendel could have derived his predictions from three simpler theoretical postulates, and rather tham from the data themselves. In all three cases, the evidential value of the data was considered along with higher-level theoretical concerns. 

**Distinguishing between null and small effects requires repeated, careful, high-sensitivity experiments.** All three groups of experimenters --- Michelson and Morley, Mendel, and the LIGO team --- are celebrated for their careful experimentation. Michelson invented multiple iterations of his device to reduce the noise in his measurements. Mendel grew thousands of pea plants across 84 experiments to demonstrate his theory. The LIGO team invested a decade honing their experimental skills before finding a single gravitational wave. Recently some have worried that demanding high precision experiments will slow down scientific progress. We worry that scientific progress isn't possible without high-precision experiments. Admittedly, high-sensitivity experiments can be difficult in psychology due to both resource constraints and natural, poorly-understood human variability. Advances in research methods, practices, and attitudes --- both statistical and more broadly --- are needed to overcome these limitations.

**Demonstration of positive effects requires the same rigor.**  When interpreting both negative results and positive results, rigor is critical. The role of potential experimental error in interpreting negative results was highlighted by @Mitchell:2014, who claimed that this possibility threatened the interpretation of negative replications (and by extension, negative results in general):

> "Because experiments can be undermined by a vast number of practical mistakes, the likeliest explanation for any failed replication will always be that the replicator bungled something along the way. Unless direct replications are conducted by flawless experimenters, nothing interesting can be learned from them." (p. 1)

Indeed, Michelson's initial 1881 null result needed to be replicated with a more reliable apparatus. If a high-precision replication were not performed, Michelson's result would have been ignored.

But this raises a critical question: if we do not trust that our colleagues were thorough and careful when they present us with negative results, why then do we trust them when they present us with positive results? Obtaining a positive result does not mean we are off the hook: detection of gravitational waves was claimed by the BICEP2 team in 2014 [@BICEP2:2014]. However, the result are now generally regarded as being confounded by galactic dust [@Cowen:2015]. The BICEP2 team was right --- gravitational waves do exist --- but their experiment did not demonstrate it. The Nobel prize in physics went to the LIGO team.

Collectively, the historic results of Michelson and Morley, Mendel, and the LIGO team show the importance of careful acceptances of null hypotheses in science. Michelson and Morley's null result allowed physics to move beyond the concept of a light-propagation medium. Mendel's null deviations from his theoretical predictions, flawed as they are, remain among the most celebrated findings in biology. The LIGO team's null results were part of a larger programme to develop the experimental tools they needed for the finding that eventially won them the highest prize in science. Carefully-interpreted null results are not failures, and should not be doomed to the file-drawer; in any healthy research programme, they must play a central role.
